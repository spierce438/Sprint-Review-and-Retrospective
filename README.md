# Sprint-Review-and-Retrospective
This deliverable pulls together the agile and Scrum practices that you have applied throughout this course.
How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

User needs are going to be asked by the clients to begin the project, but the Product Owner needs to turn those into actually understandable expectations to the team. 
These are where user stories come in. These are going to be easier for the team to understand because the Product Owner will turn the clients asks into clear goals with strict expectations to meet using input and output style explanations.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I think that the agile approach is almost the only way to go. The upsides are way more than the downsides and in today's age when something takes less time that is a huge advantage. The quickness of the agile process from start to finish makes it the Omega in my eyes.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Always be respectful to each other. This includes polite and professional conversations between members and constant communication. The pinnacle of being a good teammate is being a good communicator. We need to talk with our teammates, listen to our teammates and help when we are able to.
